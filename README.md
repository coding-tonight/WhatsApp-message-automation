# WhatsApp Messages Automation
I've used the Python pywhatkit library to develop a basic WhatsApp automation. The sole purpose of this project is to play around and experiment with the package in order to understand how Python packages operate and to either develop my own package or tweak it as needed.

## Setup in your local environment
```
   mkdir folderName
   cd folderName
   python -m venv env
   env\scripts\activate.bat
   pip install pywhatkit
```

### How to use WhatsApp autonation
#### place your phone numbers list in the phone.txt file within same dir of the script(include country code)
```
  py automate.py
```
